During the month of August the faculty will be closed to the public. Between the 4th and the 18th you will need special permission to enter the buildings. If you intend to come to the workspace during that period make sure to ask your supervisor to be included in the special permission list.
Once on the list you just have to come into the C8 building from the entrance near the security office and fill in your information as required.
