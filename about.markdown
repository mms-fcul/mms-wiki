The Molecular Modeling and Simulation (MMS) Lab is composed of several groups pushing the boundaries of several reaserch topics.

**[Machuqueiro Computational BiopHysics Lab](https://mms.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/index.html)** - lead by **Miguel Machuqueiro** focuses on studying the pH effects on biologically relevant molecules.

**[Computational Chemistry & Molecular Interactions Lab](https://ccmi.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/)** - lead by **Paulo J. Costa** focuses on better understanding (bio)molecular recognition phenomena mediated by non-covalent interactions.

**[Structure-Based Molecular Modeling Lab](https://sbmm.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/)** - lead by **Bruno L. Victor** focuses on studying and identifying regulatory structural determinants in biomolecules, that can be used in the development of new terapeutic agents.

**[Nuno Galamba Lab](https://mdl.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/)** - lead by **Nuno Galamba** focuses on studying the hydrophobic effect's role in (bio)chemical processes like protein foldeing and aggregation.

**[Electronic Structure Studies in Chemistry and Materials group](https://esscm.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/)** - lead by **Nuno A. G. Bandeira** focuses on aplying electronic structure methods to understand chemical transformations at the molecular level.

These groups share a computational workspace located at C8 Building (room 8.5.52), Faculty of Ciences of University of Lisbon, Campo Grande, 1749-016 Lisbon, Portugal
