# What is Blender?
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.  
It supports the **entire 3D pipeline**, including modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and video editing.

## Okay, what does that mean for me?
It means you can create almost anything you can imagine in **2D or 3D** — from illustrations and animations to physics-based simulations.  
In our scientific area, Blender is often used for creating **publication-quality images** and **movies** to communicate results clearly.

## Oh wow, that's pretty cool. How do I start?
