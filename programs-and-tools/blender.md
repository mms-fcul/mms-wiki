# What is Blender?
[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is a free and open-source 3D creation suite.  
It supports the **entire 3D pipeline**, including modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, and video editing.

# Okay, what does that mean for me?
It means you can create almost anything you can imagine in **2D or 3D** — from illustrations and animations to physics-based simulations.  
In our scientific area, Blender is often used for creating **publication-quality images** and **movies** to communicate results clearly.

# Oh wow, that's pretty cool. How do I start?

If you want to jump right in to making scientific images check out the following Youtube Tutorials, from 2 amazing Blender creators (and scientists):
- [PyMOL objects to Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZFVUej-bZs) – Export your scenes from PyMOL to Blender (Easier and quicker for those already familiar with PyMOL), by Verena Resch.
- [Molecular structures on Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvmFaRVmZRU&list=PLQyfz7398elUYMdeaSYVAcXffzlSIzuSw) – Open .pdb and .xtc directly on Blender (Steeper learning curve, but full control of molecular information in Blender), by Brady Johnston.
