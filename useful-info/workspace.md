Hello! This is a shared work space (~~that we call workspace, get it?~~), as such there are some conduct norms you should be aware of.

# Where to sit
When you first arrived you probably sat somewhere your supervisor told you to, but if you want to come often you should familiarize yourself with the seats that are usually occupied (by masters or PhD students). Some of these seats may seem empty but remain occupied by someone accessing remotely. Don't be afraid to ask around what seats are empty.

**When you leave always log-out of your account instead of turning off the computer**. The computers in the workspace are hard working at running simulations (some of which may even be yours), as such they should **NEVER** be turned off.

# The Air Conditioning unit
Due to housing a lot of computers always running at high load, the workspace needs to be climatized (both for the pc's and for our sake). As such you should not play around with the settings of the AC. We try to make it as comfortable for everyone as we can, but depending on your seat's location you may find you need to bring a jacket even in the summer. We ask for your compreension regarding this matter.

If for some reason you do need to change the AC settings, you can find instructions on how to adjust it AC [here]({{ '/useful-info/AC.html' | relative_url }}).
