If you are part of the Machuqueiro Lab then you probably already heard about the "[News Section](https://mms.rd.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/news.html)" in the website, where we never have enough contributions to keep the news... new and up to date. This page exists in an attempt to change that!

Thanks to JoÃ£o Vitorino, the process of creating a news entry in the website is now as simple as filling out a google forms (which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdbwW2wleGPBeKBhi-sREHJo6Gn2EffvOeTDDfzZL1oze-a1A/viewform?pli=1)). 

You will always need a couple of things, with a few other fields being optional:
## 1. Title
A short and catchy title to entice lurkers to click.

## 2. Short description
Consider that this text will also be used for social media posts (don't worry, you wont need to do that, that's someone else's work), so write with that short format in mind.

## 3. Image
In order to keep the loading of the website fast and smooth we should try to **limit the file size of the images to 1MB**. There are multiple ways to acomplish this, depending on how comfortable you are handling image editing software, but there are two main ways we recomend:
### convert 
Using the command line tool convert you can resize an already existing image (in this case named `name.png`), which in turn will also reduce its size. The command is as simple as:

```
convert name.png -resize 800x output_resized-800.jpg
```

### Photopea
The alternative is using the web browser (unoficial) photoshop tool [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/). You can simply drop in your image from the loading screen and then export (`File > Export as > JPG`)  with a lower resolution to reduce the size within the limit.
