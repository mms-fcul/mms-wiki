latex
if you are writting a report or thesis you will soon learn that latex is your best friend.
we use overleaf as our latex editor https://www.overleaf.com/
it is free to use for personal use but the free version has a limitation for shared projects. Since usually thesis and reports will need to be proofread by your supervisor what we usually do is create a template for you to use with a premiu account that then allows multiple people to access the documents at once.

however, to start out you can play around with the free account and learn the basics
